	<LongDescription>
Audio Switcher lets you replace siren, vehicle engine, and ambient sounds with custom WAV/OGG files.

Supports local audio and modules.

Custom audio is tunable via SFX behavior with settings such as volume, pitch, spatial blend, doppler, spread, min/max distance, looping, and fades.

Audio Switcher module packs are delivered as separate mods. Modules are auto-discovered and entries appear in the same dropdowns as local audio, labeled by module name, so you can mix and match local files and published audio packs in one setup.

Great for emergency vehicle sound packs, custom engine libraries, and ambient city themes.

Sirens can be blacket applied to replace an original siren or you can use specific vehicle prefab overrides.

Ambient sounds and engines sounds apply to specific prefabs.
